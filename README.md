Encrypter-Decrypter_commandline
===============================

This program has the exact same purpose as the 2 other encrypter-decrypter programs. The only thing different is that is can be run via the terminal. An example of this could be ./code.cpp -encrypt "file1.txt" "file2.txt" or ./code.cpp -decrypt "file2.txt" "file1.txt"
